# What is This?

A web widget for showing results of single elimination
tournaments. Publishers specify players and winners by simply entering
text into the HTML page. All code is client-side; no server-side
programming is needed.

## Features

Group results by:
 - Round
 - Performance (best performing players on top)
 - (optional) Country: All players from a country shown together
 - Seed
 - Publishers can choose to display fewer groups to zero in on one facet of the tournament

Filter results
 - reader can show only results matching text typed into in a text input
 - publisher can initialize the filter to zero in on specific results
 - reader or publisher can separate multiple filters by ','

Show completed tournaments or in-progress ones.

Show multiple tournaments on one web page.

Winners can be abbreviated to reduce typing: e.g. "Serena" instead of
"Serena Williams"
