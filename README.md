# What is tournabox?

A web widget for showing results of single elimination tournaments.
Visitors can change how results are grouped and filtered. Publishers
specify players and winners by entering text into the HTML page. All
code is client-side; no server-side programming is needed.

## Features

Supports any sport or game.

Shows completed tournaments or in-progress ones.

Shows multiple tournaments on one web page.

Dynamic display allows visitors to view results in different ways:

Group results by:
 - Round (latest round on top)
 - Performance (best performing players on top)
 - Country: All players from a country shown together
 - Seed (Highest seed on top, then unseeded players grouped by performance)

Filter results
 - Visitor can show only those results matching text typed into a text input
 - Separate multiple filters by ','

To reduce clutter and increase focus, publishers can set display options:

 - choose to display fewer groups, e.g. Round only
 - Initialize the filter to show specific players or groups

Winners can be abbreviated to reduce typing: e.g. "Serena" instead of
"Serena Williams"
